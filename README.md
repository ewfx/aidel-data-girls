## 🎯 Introduction
Risk is at the heart of every financial decision a bank makes. Whether it's approving loans, processing transactions, or detecting fraud, managing risk at the end of the day is critical to maintaining trust and stability. Given that how indispensable "risk" is for financial institutions, we picked up the challenge: "AI-Driven Entity Intelligence Risk Analysis"

Financial transactions, especially in high-risk areas, need a sharp eye and constant scrutiny to catch fraud, money laundering, and other threats. The problem? Traditional systems rely on fixed rules that can’t keep up with evolving risks. By bringing AI into the mix, we aim to make risk assessment more adaptive, meticulous, and efficient. Instead of just flagging obvious issues, AI digs deeper, identifying hidden patterns and emerging threats—helping us stay ahead of financial crime. Through this project, we're leveraging Gen-AI-based solutions to enhance risk assessment, bringing efficiency and precision to financial risk scoring.

## 💡 Inspiration
"Risk" is what slided us into this project. It's undeniable that financial fraudsters are getting smarter, and rule-based systems just can’t keep up. Traditional methods often drown in the flood of transactions, flagging harmless ones while letting real threats slip through. We wanted a system that doesn’t just tick boxes but thinks—an AI that can identify shady shell companies, spot politically exposed persons (PEPs), and make sense of messy transaction data. Enter Mistral-7B, the AI-powered watchdog that doesn’t just call out risks but explains why. With the ever-tightening grip of regulations and the sheer volume of financial data pouring in, manual review is no longer feasible. Our solution scales effortlessly, reducing false alarms and uncovering hidden patterns. Plus, we wanted something transparent—no more black-box decisions. If an AI says a transaction is risky, we want it to back it up with solid reasoning. That’s the dream: a smarter, faster, and more accountable way to keep financial transactions safe.
