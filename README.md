## 💡 Inspiration
Risk is at the heart of every financial decision a bank makes. Whether it's approving loans, processing transactions, or detecting fraud, managing risk at the end of the day is critical to maintaining trust and stability. Given that how indispensable "risk" is for financial institutions, we picked up the challenge: "AI-Driven Entity Intelligence Risk Analysis"

Financial transactions, especially in high-risk areas, need a sharp eye and constant scrutiny to catch fraud, money laundering, and other threats. The problem? Traditional systems rely on fixed rules that can’t keep up with evolving risks. By bringing AI into the mix, we aim to make risk assessment more adaptive, meticulous, and efficient. Instead of just flagging obvious issues, AI digs deeper, identifying hidden patterns and emerging threats—helping us stay ahead of financial crime. Through this project, we're leveraging Gen-AI-based solutions to enhance risk assessment, bringing efficiency and precision to financial risk scoring.
